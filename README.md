Problem statement is given in IP - Technical Project Solving
TOUCHLESS FINGERPRINT CAPTURING â€“ IMAGE PROCESSSING
Language and Platform: Microsoft Visual Studio using OpenCV and C++
About: Fingerprint recognition is a natural technique of transmitting a signal to a machine for human identification. A section of the human-machine interface that outlines a fast algorithm for fingertip detection may be found here. This approach is insensitive to orientation, and in preprocessing, it removes only the hand complete   image, making   subsequent portion of the computations significantly faster. Touching a rigid sensing surface produces a fingerprint. This action results in finger skin deformation and necessitates the usage of external physical devices. To avoid the foregoing impacts, we employ cameras to capture a person's fingertips, which are then translated from BGR to HSV color space; this process is known as TOUCHLESS CAPTURING OF FINGERPRINT. We extract the Region of Interest (ROI) with the help of contours utilizing HSV color space, and then store the resulting unique Fingerprints in a data base that may be accessed later.
